# TIL6010

The course is a hands-on course for students to learn the fundamentals of coding and python programming language. With the course, we will cover the software installation, setting up the environment, and introduction to collaborative/versioning tools such as GitHub. Furthermore, this course will aid in developing programming skills from conceptualizing problems into schemes and data structures suitable for a computer to solve. Python, its tools and syntax, will be taught to develop these skills through hands-on learning activities and lab sessions. Assignments about traffic and logistics provide concrete examples of using Python to solve real-world problems. While the students will work with different datasets during their in-class learning activities, they will delve in-depth into a single dataset for their assignment.

This repository will be used to share the datasets, course materials, python and git cheatsheets and use to share and tackle errors.
